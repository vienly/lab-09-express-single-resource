======

# To Submit this Assignment
  * fork this repository
  * write all of your code in a directory named `lab-` + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab-duncan`
  * push to your repository
  * submit a pull request to this repository
  * submit a link to your PR in canvas
  * write a question and observation on canvas

# Build Tool Instructions
* create a package.json that lists all dependencies and developer dependencies
* include an .eslintrc
* include a .gitignore
* create a gulpfile
 * have a lint task for running eslint
 * have a test task for running mocha
 * have a nodemon task that restarts your server any time a change has been bade to your **.js** files
 * have a default task for running the lint and mocha tasks

# Directions
* Create these directories to organize your code:
 * lib
 * model
 * route
 * test
* Create a HTTP Server using `express`
* Create an Object Constructor that creates an AppError
 * create message, statusCode and responseMessage properties
 * add static methods to the Constructor that check if an error is an `instanceof` AppError
 * add statick methods for creating 400, 404, and 500 error messages
 * Use the AppErrors any where you find an error in your app.
 * If you encounter an error in your route respoond with the AppError status code, and response message
* Create a Object Constructor that creates a _simple resource_ with at least 3 properties
 * An `id` property that is set to a unique **node-uuid** id is required
 * Also include two other properties of your choice (like name, creationDate, etc.)
* use the `body-parser` express middleware to on `POST` and `PUT` routes
* use the npm `debug` module to log the functions being executed in your app
* using the express `Router` create a route for doing **RESTFUL CRUD** operations on your _simple resource_
 * store all objects created on the in memory `storage` module we created in lecture

## Server Endpoints
### `/api/simple-resource-name`
* `POST` request
 * pass data as stringifed json in the body of a post request to create a resource

### `/api/simple-resource-name/:id`
* `GET` request
 * pass the id of a resource though the url endpoint to `req.params` to fetch a simple-resource   
* `PUT` request
 * pass data as stringifed json in the body of a put request to update a resource
* `DELETE` request
 * pass the id of a resource though the url endpoint to `req.params` to delete a simple-resource   

## Tests
* your tests should start your server when they begin and stop your server when they finish
* write a test to ensure that your api returns a status code of 404 for routes that have not been registered
* write tests to ensure your `/api/simple-resource-name` endpoint responds as described for each condition below:
 * `GET` - test 404, responds with 'not found' for valid request made with an id that was not found
 * `GET` - test 400, responds with 'bad request' if no id was provided in the request
 * `GET` - test 200, response body like `{<data>}` for a request made with a valid id
 * `PUT` - test 400, responds with 'bad request' for if no `body provided` or `invalid body`
 * `PUT` - test 200, response body like  `{<data>}` for a post request with a valid body
 * `POST` - test 400, responds with 'bad request' for if no `body provided` or `invalid body`
 * `POST` - test 200, response body like  `{<data>}` for a post request with a valid body

## Bonus
* **2pts** a `GET` request to `/api/simple-resource-name/all` should retrun an array of all of the ids for that resource
* **1pt** write tests for the `DELETE` request
